drop table if exists tasks;

-- 5.3 Add 'profile id uuid ...'
-- 5.4 And we also need to rename the tasks schema, so that it has later timestamp time, as the profiles schema, because it decides the order of creating and we need it to after profiles being created.
-- 5.5 And with that in place we do in the console: npm run db:reset which will reset the DB with all of the changes weâ€™ve made and then npm run db:seed which will create the testing user and all of the other stuff.
